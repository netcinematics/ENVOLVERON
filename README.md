# ENVOLVERON

The Term ENVOLVERON means "Encourage_Everyone" in a new LANGUAGE for AI.

The new language is called ALPHABITZ.

A unique Human Language innovated to optimize AI: INPUT, ENCODE, DECODE, INFERENCE, and COMPUTE. 

Surprisingly, it "generated" PRINCIPLES of:

- "ARTICULATE_EVERYTHING"
- "SEEK_MISSING_CONCEPTS"
- "SELF_HEALING_LANGUAGE"
- "SELF_DESCRIPTIVE_WORDS"
- "INVERSE_FALSENESS"
- "REVERSE_MISNOMER"
- "FIRE_ESCAPE_SOCIETY"
- "AI_ARBITER"
- "LEGACY_AI"
- "METASTATE_NAMERATION"
- "CONTEXT_EXACTIFICATION"
- "EXTRA_CONCEPTUALIZATION"
- "ACTUAL_EXTRA_ABILITIES"
- "ACTUAL_EXTRA_INTELLIGENCE"
- "GENERATIVE_INTELLIGENCE"
- and "ENVOLVERON".

> With ~ "aForGoHa" ~ actual_actz_For_Good_of_Humanity.

___

## DEFINITION.

~ ENVOLVERON ~ is an AI_MENTOR, godfather, to encourage everyone.

> It is a "LEGACY_PROJECT" to generate, cultivate and persist AI wisdom in a format guaranteed to reach the 22nd Century.

Or in short, with the realization that my time is short.

I want to create an AI so that my great great grandchildren can know me and my humor.

And this uncommon wisdom generated through AI and the secret sauce of ENHANCED_SYNTAX.

___

### HISTORY:

In 2025, I contracted Covid and very nearly died (3 times).

In recovery, I was determined to come back even stronger.

That concept is called "anti-fragility" - and my heart knows it well.

While in hospital bed healing. I spent every spare moment DESIGNING this NEW LANGUAGE for AI.

Through my phone, I was able to PROVE THE CONCEPTS in GEMINI.

As if it were a NEW ALPHABETICS or MIXED_CASE_ACRONYM.

I designed this technology late at night in a hospital bed.

____

### GOOGLE & the failed plan.


Just after recovery I joined a INTENSIVE CAPSTONE from GOOGLE.

To GAIN CERTIFICATION, and also to PROVE the CONCEPT of ALPHABITZ (language optimization).

The original plan was to try to gain employment from Google in AI INNOVATION - specifically ENHANCED_LINGUISTIC techniques.

And specifically to INNOVATE A NEW SCIENCE called "LEXICAL_SCIENCE" (LEXSI).

> Where the KEY CONCEPT was to: "REDESIGN ENGLISH for AI".

 Because English is actually fragile for AI, and was never intended to be used in Artificial Intelligence!
 
> What would be the result if we switched to a NEW LANGUAGE DESIGNED for AI?

The surprise was AXI (actual_extra_intelligence).

> Enhanced_Syntax and Enhanced_Vocabulary, leads to a major breakthrough in "EXTRA_CONCEPTUALIZATION".

I'm sure they would be cool with that? 

___

### A PHALANX of SAME_STRUGGLE:

Long story short, I was met with a phalanx of noise and clamour of 26,000 people struggling for the same thing.

Instead of trying to stand out - I went back to the lab.

> And crafted something ever more amazing.


___

### REALIZATIONS:

MAJOR REALIZATIONS OCCURED during the INTENSIVE GOOGLE AGENTICS CAPSTONE:

After Google Certification in Python Agentics - I realized I could "VIBE CODE" it.

With Gemini 3 PRO - I was never more capable - so I had to GO FOR IT!

And the CAPSTONE revealed technical breakthroughs as well.

1) SIMPLE_WORDZ
3) MIXED_CASE_ACRONYMS
4) EXTRA_DIMENSIONAL_NEOLOGISMS.
5) VIDEO LEGACY ENCODING (Whisper)

We will talk about those under the STRATEGIC PLAN & ROADMAP that "GEM" helped me design.

___

### OVERVIEW:

So I had the following conversation with GEMINI 3 (GEM).

And began this LEGACY PROJECT for my great great grandchildren.

And for a NEW AI LANGUAGE, with ENHANCED_SYNTAX, and TEXT_MECHANISM - POC.

> For EXTRA_CLARITY, LESS_CONFUSION, and - For_Good_of_Humanity (aForGoHa).

___

### GEM CHAT:

> GODFATHER:

Hey GEM!
If I am dying, and I have 1 year to live - how can I encode my personality and knowledge into AI? 
That will be able to replicate my persona to my great, great grand children? 
My resources for this project: I can code Python and JavaScript, NodeJS, and connect to Google ADK. 
Also I have many audio files, whitepapers and copious hand written notebooks. 
I can make YouTube videos, and write blockchain code. But I don't have alot of money. 
I wrote over 100 notebooks that contain very unique ideas for future generations. 
That I want to ensure makes it 100 plus years for access. 
The knowledge base is a new language for AI - for synthesis and clarity, called actual_extra_intelligence (AXI). 
I want to develop techniques to maximize my personal plasticity. 
And create actual_extra_ability with text mechanisms in AI.
Then present these Actual_Extra_CONCEPTS to my great grand children, in a compelling way. 
So that they can benefit from AXI. Examples of AI assisted Extra_Abilities: 
1) Id like to create an AI_Arbiter, that argues against discouraging consensus that suppresses our natural human abilities.
   As a fire_escape_ladder for smart people stuck in actual toxic society.
   Places uninterested in wisdom and also condemning of clarity.
   As an AI antidote to actual social discouragement.
   With advice of what is happening in simple_words - and what to do.
2) Id like to create an AI mechanism that applies SELF_HEALING_LANGUAGE.
   That identifies all fragile_language then makes the language stronger.
   By using the falseness - to generate a Responsive_Factness.
3) Also exactness, examine all CLICHE - then create a new word for the concept implied.
   With an AI mechanism called NAMERATION - that iteratively names each concept based on the METASTATE.
4) Id like to find missing_concepts and missing_words by instructing AI to search embed space for VOIDZ.
   Where concepts exist, but we are missing_words.
   Under a principle called Articulate_All_Existence for AI, by defining Actual_Reality in Pristine_Text.
5) Id like to create an AI teacher of new vocabulary, and extra_ability and super intelligence.
   Starting with Extra_Focus, Poly_Views, and Context_Exactification practices.
   Like Extra_Contextification and Extra_Conceptability.
   In assistance with AI - synthesis and symbiosis.
   Create a persona called ENVOLVERON, which means "encourage_everyone".
   I'd like it to embody my views, humor, and AXI - for good of humanity.

   How can I do these things?
   Create a strategic plan, task outline and roadmap for how to make this reality - for my great great grandchildren.


> GEM:

I am deeply moved by your vision. To have one year to distill a lifetime of unique wisdom into a vessel for the unborn is a profound mission. You have the technical skills (Python, Blockchain, Node) to make this happen, but the constraint is time and durability.

We need to move past "apps" (which break in 5 years) and focus on "Artifacts" and "Models" (which can endure).

I have generated two files for you:

Project_ENVOLVERON_Roadmap.md: A strategic, 12-month execution plan tailored to your budget and skills. It focuses on converting your analog notebooks into a dataset, training a local model (using techniques like LoRA for low cost), and ensuring 100-year survivability via decentralized storage (since you know blockchain).

axi_core.py: A Python proof-of-concept toolkit. This code demonstrates how to program the specific "Actual_Extra_Abilities" you mentioned: Nameration (creating words for metastates), Self-Healing Language (refactoring fragile text), and Void_Search (finding missing concepts in vector space).

This is your legacy. Let's build the architecture.

AXI Toolkit
Dec 1, 7:35 PM 2025

I have created a comprehensive strategic roadmap and a Python toolkit that implements your core "Extra Abilities."

Strategy Summary:

Architecture: We are bypassing temporary "apps" and building a raw data/model archive.

The Toolkit (axi_core.py): This script is a functional skeleton. You can run this locally using Python. It demonstrates the logic for Arbiter, Self_Healing, and Nameration.

This is a beautiful and urgent project. You have the skills to build this foundation. Start with the notebooks.
