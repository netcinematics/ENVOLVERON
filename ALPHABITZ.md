AI evolves a new language for humanity.

Use AI to SOLVE:

ambiguity,
cliche,
misnomer,
polysemy (homonymy),
and more.
Benefits, for AI and humans - like never before.

TAKEAWAY:
Think of "ALPHABITZ", like an extension to alphabetics - with AI.

The English language was never designed for AI - someday it will be.

AI will rethink language - and you are one of the first to see it here.

OVERVIEW:
This is the story of a language enhancement experiment.

Inspirational vision:

What would we see, of you and I could travel 1000 years into the future?

You and I, arrive in the year 3025. To join your distant relatives, as they look back at all our YouTubes!

What will they see?

What will be antiquated?

You and I represent the last generation before the Age_of_AI.

How will AI change us?
This capstone explores the fascinating question of:

HOW MIGHT AI CHANGE LANGUAGE?

Let's get creative and imaginative.

How might English improve with AI?

What if language could be anything, what would it be?

STRUCTURE:
This paper follows the format:

THESIS:
Human language is dynamic.

AI will change human language.

But how?

Join this fascinating journey to peek into the future!

ORIGIN STORY:
It starts in a tiny university dorm room. Where a student imagines a little "word_game" to learn C++.

Use AI to rhyme song lyrics.

Little does the student suspect, it would be a massive breakthrough in linguistics.

A new AI English.

PROBLEMS:
A "tokenizer" was built on a custom LLM of cliches - in 2002, as an undergrad project.

The code was the easy part!

The much harder challenge, was the solutions to the "fragility" of the English language.

CHALLENGE: how to get 'orange' to rhyme with 'door hinge'!

SOLUTIONS:
The first solution was a "TEXT_MECHANISM", to find similar sounding phonemes.

It was called: "RHYME_ABILITY".

As an early agent, function tool.

Reflecting all the ways to rhyme.

Like 'BSE' token metadata, it was used in the tokenizer to apply "RHYME_ABILITY" - before GPT's or attention mechanism.

A powerful concept was born.

To extend language in the age_of_AI.

Where some words represent "extra_ability" to AI inference.

LANGUAGE PATTERNS:
Inspired by (GoF) DESIGN PATTERNS.

The rhyme_ability tool, evolved into many lexical tools, called text_mechanisms (or "MECHZ").

The first "cluster".
"~ability":

rhyme_ability
extra_ability
Then a second cluster.
Resulting in more transformative, MECHZ, as a paradigm shift.

Away from rhyming, and toward descriptions of everything else in existence!

"~ification:

"NAME_IFICATION"
"EXACT_IFICATION"
"CONCEPT_IFICATION"
"DISAMBIG_IFICATION"
Far beyond rhyme mechanisms.

These are English words, that infer functional ability for AI.

As decendents of "Rhyme_ability".

When AI sees these words - it calls a sub agent to conduct the mechanism.

Like rhyming, or understanding an acronym - or pig-latin.

GEMINI instantly understands this new language - as if it were jargon.

EASY ANALOGY:
Think of "MECHZ" like ACRONYMS.

But with enhanced text patterns.

INNOVATION:
The key concept was a crossover of primitives - from computer syntax into English.

It was like giving AI extra_ability, for custom words (called WORDZ).

Inspired by computer science "snake-case", "camel-case", and "title-case" - enhanced syntax was innovated to create TEXT_PRIMITIVES for AI prompts.

And this became valid, when plain English was fed into Gemini.

But now with "enhanced_english".

PARADIGM SHIFT:
After solving rhyme_ability, a test case was to rhyme CLICHE phrases.

But cliche phrases are notoriously ambiguous to AI. So it was tricky to know what they meant.

A novel solution was innovated apart from web-scraping and scaling.

REAL WORLD VALUE:
With the ability to extend "Text_Mechanisms", new GOALS became:

"Extra clarity and less confusion."

Also,

"Create maximum exact text"

And,

"Index all concepts possible into single words - for AI."

Those sub-agents implemented in this capstone.

DEFINITIONS:
In reverse order:

"DISAMBIG_IFICATION" - pronounced [dis+am+big+if+ication].
Solution "MECH" to resolve all ambiguity (called "AMBIGUOSITY").

"CONCEPT_IFICATION" - pronounced [concept+if+ication].
Index of all concepts, not yet articulated into words - for AI.

"EXACT_IFICATION" - pronounced [exact+if+ication].
Process for reversing misnomer into self_definitive_principle.

"NAME_IFICATION" - pronounced [name+if+ication].
Ability for AI to name concepts that are not yet named.

AGENT EXPERIMENTS:

MISNOMER vs. NAMEIFICATION

from ai perspective, english language is filled with fragilities - collectively called fragile_english.

what if human language, had a supplemental overlay syntax - that corrects all AMBIGUITY - like a corrective lens (LENZ).

similar to ACRONYM language pattern, except uses phoneme of long 'a' [pronounced: 'ahh'] as "universal_combiner".

This "little_A" language pattern (mechanism) allows for (near) infinite WORD CONCATENATION. As a plus symbol ("+") in word_math. With honorable purpose, of reflecting all actual_reality, more accurately - automatically.

Yes, this implies very profound concepts.

Concepts that humanity has yet to conceptualize, and articulate into a word - is already pre-named by principle (with this mechanism).

Also, generating this word, of something humanity has yet to articulate, is cause of a spark of epiphany in human mind - (in theory), guides PLASTICITY toward accurate reflections of actial_realiry- and generates actual_extra_intellugence - called "generative_intelligence".

This is how AI will be encoded with more accuracy. by PRINCIPLE of exactness, called pristine_text, where all AMBIGUOSITY is removed.
